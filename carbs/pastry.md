# Pastry

Makes 1 pie crust (top and bottom)

## Ingredients

- 3 cups flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 3/4 lb fat, such as lard, margarine or butter
- 1 egg, whipped
- 1 tbsp white vinegar
- 1/2 cup cold water
- Plastic wrap

## Method

In a bowl or stand mixer, mix flour and salt.

Cut fat into 1 inch inch cubes and mix until lumps of fat are pea sized.

Mix egg and vinegar, then combine with cold water. Pour into mix while blending, until the dough sticks together.

Cut dough in two, form into balls and cover in plastic wrap. Place in fridge for 2 hours, or in freezer for 30 minutes.

## Tips

- When rolling the dough out, handle minimally. Good pastry dough should keep the fat in chunks to create a pleasant flake, and the heat from you hands will melt fat deposits.
- If covering hot fillings, the quicker you can fill the pastry, the better, as the heat will make it easier to break over time.
- Use flour generously when rolling out the pastry to ensure it doesn't stick to your surface or rolling pin.
- You can add spices to your dough (i.e. curry powder or turmeric for Jamaican Patties), or sugar to sweeten it.
